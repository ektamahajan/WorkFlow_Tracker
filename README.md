Developed a website in ASP.net MVC, Javascript, JQuery, HTML and CSS. There are two roles- user and admin. A new user can register to the website to use Workflow Tracker. Users can create multiple projects, which will automatically create steps, which are predefined by Admin. User can check status, progress, actual/estimated start and end date and other details of project and steps. Users and Admin can edit the details. Admin can enable or disable users and steps as required.They can add comments to mention the changes they made in the steps with a facility to upload the file. There is a facility for the users to generate history report of all the changes they made on a project or step level. It also provides a calendar view on a project level, displaying all of the steps on it.
